# C-Projex


1. http-server --> Created a simple http server using c (similar to the python inbuilt server i.e, python -m http.server but written in c :) )
                    (Execute the server.c file & to test it out you could curl localhost:8080 or just use any broswer and go to localhost at the 8080 port)
2. operating systems --> Contains applications of concepts learned in the OS course in college
